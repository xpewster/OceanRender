/*
  The Buffer class is essentially a wrapper for an istream.
  It is here mainly to keep track of the current file location
  (line number, column number) to print intelligent error messages.


  If you find yourself changing stuff in this file, you're probably
  doing something wrong.

  This class was borrowed from the stock PL0 source code used for
  CSE401, because I didn't feel like rewriting it. 
  ( see http://www.cs.washington.edu/401 for details )
